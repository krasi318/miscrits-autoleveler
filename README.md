# Miscrits Auto-Leveler 

This is a legacy project from an older attempt to automate the leveling process in the game Miscrits. The core idea was to streamline repetitive in-game actions through scripting, aiming to reduce the grind and make gameplay more enjoyable.

⚙️ What It Does
The script was designed to:

Automate battles for experience farming.

Detect visual game states via image comparison.

Simulate user inputs to perform standard in-game actions.

❌ Why It Didn't Work (Yet)
The main limitation of the original version came down to how image comparison was implemented. It relied on pixel-perfect matching — which turned out to be too brittle. Even minor variations in rendering (like shadows, effects, or compression artifacts) caused the system to fail.

🔁 What's Next
I'm revisiting this project with new ideas:

More robust image recognition using perceptual hashing or ML-based approaches.

Potential integration with lightweight computer vision tools.

Stay tuned — this project might get a second life!

❗ Disclaimer: This tool is intended to reduce repetitive gameplay and enhance user experience — not to gain unfair advantage over others.
